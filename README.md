# Job-Recommender-System - Data Analysis & Visualisation
>A job recommender system was developed involving extensive data analysis and visualization. Clustering techniques were implemented to group job preferences and skills, enhancing recommendation accuracy. Four algorithms were applied to refine recommendations, leveraging data insights to match candidates with suitable roles effectively.
